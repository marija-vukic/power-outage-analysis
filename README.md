# US Power Outage Analysis
By Marija Vukic and Sadrac Santacruz Ibarra

# Introduction
Throughtout this project, we explore major power outage events in the US from January 2000 to July 2016, using a data set curated by [*Purdue Universityâ€™s Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure*](https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages).

FINISH INTRODUCTION ONCE YOU HAVE THE REST OF THE PROJECT DONE AND YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU IMPLEMENTED AND EXPLORED
BASICALLY TURN THIS INTO A MINI ABSTRACT WITHOUT GIVING AWAY ALL OUR INSIGHTS
our website should be focused on story telling in a concise scientific manner
